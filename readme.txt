== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Chartbeat? =

Chartbeat is a real-time analytics and uptime monitoring service used
by everyone from mom-and-pop bloggers to some of the biggest sites on
the web. Try the [demo](http://chartbeat.com/demo/) and then sign up
for [a free trial](https://chartbeat.com/signup/)!

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin makes it easy for chartbeat users to install the code they
need to add to their site that enables chartbeat to track what's
happening. Adding this plugin to your site if you do not have a
chartbeat account will not provide you with any analytics.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

No, chartbeat's code is completely asynchronous. That means that it
doesn't begin to run until everything else has already loaded.

= How is this different from Google Analytics? =

Chartbeat provides statistics in real-time and sends you alerts if
your site goes down or your traffic spikes. This allows you to quickly
respond by fixing your server, improving your content, responding to
other bloggers, or whatever is appropriate for your site. Because
chartbeat sends pings throughout a user's session, you also get a much
richer sense of how people are using your site.
